# Memory Game

A project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree course.

You can play it [here](https://lukaszrozej.github.io/memory-game/)

## How to play

Click on cards to flip them and find cards that match.
Flipping 2 cards counts as one move.
Your star rating is based on number of moves you need to match all cards.
You start with 3 stars and lose one when you make moves number 13, 17 and 21.
